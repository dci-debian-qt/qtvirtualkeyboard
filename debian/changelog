qtvirtualkeyboard-opensource-src (5.7.1+dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add pkg-config as a build dependency, it is used to detect the system's
    hunspell.
  * Revert the internal dependencies order: it's the plugin that needs the
    QML module and not the other way around.
  * Add hunspell-en-gb as a test build dependency, is it used to check
    hunspell's functionality.
