qtvirtualkeyboard-opensource-src (5.10.1+dfsg-2) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Refresh disable_test_qtbug_61279.patch.
  * Make tests non-fatal. The failing ones are really flaky and it seems not
    that easy to patch them out so let's ignore them for now. We can reenable
    them once upstream solves the related bugs, see
    tests/auto/inputpanel/BLACKLIST.

qtvirtualkeyboard-opensource-src (5.9.1+dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Lisandro Damián Nicanor Pérez Meyer ]
  * Add pkg-config as a build dependency, it is used to detect the system's
    hunspell.
  * Revert the internal dependencies order: it's the plugin that needs the
    QML module and not the other way around.

  [ Dmitry Shachnev ]
  * New upstream release.
  * Bump Qt build-dependencies to 5.9.1.
  * Do not exclude the whole src/virtualkeyboard/3rdparty/ directory from
    the tarball, but only its tcime and pinyin subdirectories.
  * Drop disable_third_party.patch, third-party stuff is already disabled
    by default (except hunspell).
  * Update debian/copyright.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 4.0.0, no changes needed.

    hunspell's functionality.
